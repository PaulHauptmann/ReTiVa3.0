The power of your voice! ReTiVa evaluates the emotions in your voice in real time. At any given time you have insights on which emotion you convey. 
Additionally, it analyzes the level of interest that you radiate and how pleasant or unpleasant you perceive your environment. 
In every situation you do not only convey one single emotion but rather a complex construct of multiple emotions. With ReTiVA you track this mix of emotions and define goals for your conversation. 

This tool helps you to monitor your performance from an objective point of view. It shows you what exactly you need to optimize.
The goal is to help you have more successful conversations and presentations with your colleagues and especially your clients in your day-to-day working life.
